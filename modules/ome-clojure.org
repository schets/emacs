  website to keep update with the lastest version.

[[http://www.clojure.org][Clojure]] is a modern Lisp on top of JVM, it is a member of the Lisp family of
languages. Clojure extends the code-as-data system beyond parenthesized lists
(s-expressions) to vectors and maps.

Since Clojure is a Lisp dialect, it should work the SLIME way. Yeah, first
comes [[https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure][swank-clojure]], then [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][CIDER]][1]. The only thing you need to install is
[[http://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] 2.x. I recommend you to install it manually, since not all [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Packaging][package
manager]] provides the latest version.

The general way to install lastest stable leiningen is:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget -O /tmp/lein https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
sudo mv /tmp/lein /usr/bin/lein
lein version
#+END_SRC

Or you can see leiningen's [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading][wiki]] for upgrading details.

Now, just open a clojure file, then =cider-jack-in=, and you can program
Clojure the SLIME way. [[http://vimeo.com/22798433][Here]] is an awesome live demo to demonstrate the Clojure
workflow.

It's really really awesome, ah?

* Todos
- The boot up speed of JVM is too slow, so we may need to refer to
  http://icylisper.github.io/jark/.


[1] CIDER was formerly known as and renamed from =nrepl.el=.
