#+TITLE: Oh My Emacs Auto-mode
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil ^:nil

This is part of the [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]].

This file contains various settings for minor file types, such as SCons build
file, archlinux's PKGBUILD file, etc.

* SCons
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: scons
  :END:

[[http://www.scons.org/][SCons]] is a next generation build system that is much easier to configure and
use than the traditional make utility. SCons uses the Python general purpose
programming language as a foundation, and all SCons build files are Python
scripts, so we just set SCons build file work with python-mode.

#+NAME: scons
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("SConstruct" . python-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Puppet
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: puppet
  :END:

[[https://puppetlabs.com/][Puppet]] is configuration management tool from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_Labs][Puppet Labs]], it is the de facto
industry standard for IT automation. Puppet is written by ruby but has its own
DSL, so the emacs builtin =ruby-mode= is not proper for editing puppet files.

#+NAME: puppet
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ome-puppet-mode-setup ()
  (when (featurep 'evil)
    (add-hook 'puppet-mode-hook 'turn-on-evil-mode)))

(ome-install 'puppet-mode)
#+END_SRC

* ArchLinux PKGBUILD
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: pkgbuild
  :END:

A PKGBUILD is an Arch Linux package build description file, which is actually
a shell script. Thus you can edit PKGBUILD file with emacs
=shell-script-mode=, however, =pkgbuild-mode= provides a better workflow based
on =shell-script-mode= for PKGBUILD files, including:
- A default PKGBUILD template as a starting point
- Some shortcuts to update md5sum, browse package's website, build tarball,
  etc.

Just install =pkgbuild-mode= from =el-get= will bring all this goodies to your
fingertips.

#+NAME: pkgbuild
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (executable-find "pacman")
  (ome-install 'pkgbuild-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Wikipedia
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: wikipedia
  :END:

Wikitext language, or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup][wiki markup]], is a lightweight markup language used to
write pages in wiki websites, such as Wikipedia, and is a simplified
alternative/intermediate to HTML. Its ultimate purpose is to be converted by
wiki software into HTML, which in turn is served to web browsers.

Unfortunately, there is no commonly accepted standard wikitext language. So I
just pick =wikipedia-mode=, which is one of the many possible packages from
el-get, as the mode for editing wiki documents. If you have better choice,
please tell me.

#+NAME: wikipedia
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ome-wikipedia-mode-setup ()
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
               '("\\.wiki\\'" . wikipedia-mode)))

(ome-install 'wikipedia-mode)
#+END_SRC
* YAML
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: yaml
  :END:

[[http://www.yaml.org/][YAML]] is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming
languages. I really like it for its simplicity and readability. However, Emacs
didn't have a builtin mode for editing YAML files, so you know how easy to
solve this by adopting =el-get=. Thanks =el-get= again!

#+NAME: yaml
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ome-yaml-mode-setup ()
  (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (linum-mode 1))))

(ome-install 'yaml-mode)
#+END_SRC
